description=Nothing short of a through-route, Phoenix is a science park attached along a major roadway, offering convenient access to local industries, education centres, and St. Domingo, the region's Hospital. For many, Phoenix is a mere place to pass through, but for office workers, merchants, students and more, Phoenix is a place of business.
