description=California - Population 2760. NOTE: Another great map but has some problems with a few of it's stairs, until it's author updates it. <LINE><LINE>
description=A few of the stairs a player can fall through and fracture a leg. For serious gameplay it's best to stay at ground level exploration (avoid stairs) and use the map for supplies and exploration, rather than base building there.
